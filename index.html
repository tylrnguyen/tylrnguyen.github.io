    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-section">
      <p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a current Junior from San Jose California pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering with a Machine Learning Concentration at Boston University.</p>
      <p>I'm fascinated by the way software and deep learning models shape our everyday lives—powering everything from personalized recommendations to cutting-edge medical advancements. I love exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of what’s possible and I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and create.</p>
      <p>During my free time, I love making laser engraved gifts, watching Liverpool games, and learning to play the guitar. I also really enjoy taking photos and learning Adobe Creative Cloud softwares. When I'm not trying to animate logos in After Effects, I spend my time filming BU's hockey team.</p>

          <h3>SafeContractors</h3>
          <p>SafeContractors was built for the Civic Hacks 2025 economic track. Our goal was to provide a reliable database for people in the Boston Area to background check contractors. The database scraped with SQL was stored in MariaDB, and a FAST API was created to fetch the past contracting projects, amount paid, status, and an brief summary detailing whether the contractor is worth hiring.</p>
          <p>Received award for <i>Best Overall Hack</i> and <i>Best Scam Protection</i></p>

          <h3>Automated Hackathon Judging System</h3>
          <p>As a program ambassador for Boston University's Technology Innovation Scholar Program started by former BU Engineering Dean Ken Lutchen, I had the privilege of being apart of the Technical Team for Boston University Hacks High School (BUHHS).</p>
          <p>Prior to the Hackathon, I developed a judging system using React and MongoDB to create a software to automate scoring. In past years, parsing through judge scores took over 30 minutes, which significantly hindered the flow of the hackathon and was stressful for organizers.</p>
          <p>Additionally, through this experience, I assisted in organizing workshops and the keynote speaker for the event, which was Steve Dertien - PTC's current EVP.</p>

          <h3>Morse Code Translator</h3>
          <p>The morse code translator was an interactive decoder through an FPGA board, aimed for users to increase their fluidity in the morse code language. The project was built using Verilog to interpret user inputs as dots and dashes, which were then displayed through visual graphic array adapted from an open source ASCII-ROM.</p>

          <h3>Antidote</h3>
          <p>Antidote was made for the 2023 Lutron Lighting Competition hosted by Boston University Singh Imagineering Lab. Meant for those with seasonal depression, we created a window that emulated different times of day. To create this, we used an Arduino Uno and coded a C program to change the colors of specific LEDs.</p>
